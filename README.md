Well hello there.

I am but a humble software developer who still has much to learn.
My programming experience has so far been dominated by the languages C++ and Java in their application to create console-applications for desktop-environments,
but in recent time I have also had multiple opportunities to hone my skills in the field of web-development, especially with backends that provide REST-APIs.

If you look at any of my repositories and see potential for improvement or have feedback, then feel free to issue a pull request or let me know.
