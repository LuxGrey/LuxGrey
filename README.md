Well hello there.

I am but a humble software developer who still has much to learn.
I was introduced to programming with C++ and Java.
These days I am employed as a Full Stack Developer who mostly writes PHP.

If you look at any of my repositories and see potential for improvement or have feedback, then feel free to issue a pull request or let me know.
